hey guys,

so each person has their own branch to develop in

all code is to be developed in an individuals branch

once a segment of code is written that works (function, method, header file, etc) 
it can be committed and merged with the main branch

then all users will pull from the main line and incorperate into their code

this allows us to work independently and not have to worry about sending the code
every where

Also, no Orr-code allowed. Let's keep this professional.
